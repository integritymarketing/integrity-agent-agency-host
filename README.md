# Agent Shared Context

A microfrontend-compatible shared context module built for the Integrity platform. This package exposes global providers—such as `AppGlobalProvider`—to downstream microfrontend applications via Vite Module Federation. It centrally manages agent and agency authentication using Auth0, enabling consistent and secure login experiences across integrated apps.

## 🔑 Setting Up `.npmrc` and GitHub Token

To publish or install private packages from GitHub, you need to create a `.npmrc` file in the root of your project and include your GitHub personal access token. **Do not share or commit your token.**

### 1. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token**

- Go to your GitHub account settings.
- Navigate to **Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
- Generate a new token with the `read:packages` (and `write:packages` if you plan to publish) permissions.
- **Copy the token and keep it secure.**

### 2. **Create a `.npmrc` File**

Add the following content to your `.npmrc` file:

```plaintext
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token you generated.

### 3. **Set the Token Securely for Installation**

**Do NOT commit your `.npmrc` file with the token to version control.**  
Instead, you can use an environment variable for local development:

#### **For PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
npm install
```

#### **For Bash (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
npm install
```

Then, in your `.npmrc`, use:

```plaintext
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

> **Note:**
>
> - This environment variable approach works with `npm` and Yarn v3+ (not Yarn v1).
> - Never share or commit your token.
> - For CI/CD, set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a secret/environment variable in your pipeline settings.
